# desk-wallet

Nebulas wallet for the pc client. Nebulas users can use it to send transactions and submit smart contracts. It also manages the local node of the nebulas.

Nebulas already has a JavaScript library [neb.js](https://github.com/nebulasio/neb.js) that implements address generation, transaction signing, and submission. We will use the [electron](https://electronjs.org/) to implement our client.

### TODO list

- generate nebulas address/account
- send transaction (NAS & NRC20)
- send offine transaction
- view address/account info
- view transaction status & info
- deploy/call smart contract
- choose nebulas network(Testnet, Mainnet etc.)
- manage nebulas node
